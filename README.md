Project Codename - GoDeeper
========

This mod is still very early in development. Feel free to poke around in my code, and if you find anything that is poorly optimized or done incorrectly, please let me know. There is currently no download available for the mod, but this will be released into an open beta once all features are at least partially implemented (I know it seems like all mods only ever come out in beta and never get finished, but once everything is implemented, there will be a non-beta version of this). The name of the mod is still up to debate as well, but I'm just going to leave it as is for the time being.

If, for whatever reason you decide to compile this and use it in its current, highly unstable state, the only prerequisite mod that is required is Thermal Expansion, and of course Forge.
