RULES FOR MODPACKS
For clarity's sake modpacks will be classified by 3 types:

-Private: Modpack is made for personal use for a single individual, may be shared among a few.
-Semi-Public: Modpack is downloadable, but is not displayed prominently in any launcher and can only be accessed with a URL. If used on a server, it will only be used on 1-3 servers.
-Public: Modpack is very easily accessible through a mod launcher or website and will have a large number of users.

Permission is needed to use my mods in Public modpacks and is highly encouraged for Semi-Public modpacks. You are free to use my mods in private modpacks that are only shared among a small (1-6) group of people.
Use of any of my mods in a modpack that receives funds that provide personal profit is forbidden, as it is by Mojang's EULA for Minecraft.

MOD MODIFICATION
As many of my mods expand upon publicly available APIs or have dependencies in other mods due to the nature of modding, you are free to modify any of my mods by utilizing the source available here, or acquired though deobfuscation.
Any modified copy of my mod through the use of any tool (modified source, MineTweaker, etc..) is inelligible to receive tech support.
